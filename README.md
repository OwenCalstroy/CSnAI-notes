# CSnAI-notes
This collection contains my detailed notes and explorations on topics related to Computer Science (CS) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Throughout my studies and independent research, Iâ€™ve delved into various key areas of these dynamic fields, focusing on both foundational concepts and advanced techniques.

The content includes insights from formal courses, hands-on projects, and in-depth readings on a wide range of subjects, such as algorithms, data structures, machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, computer vision, neural networks, and AI ethics. It serves as a personal repository of knowledge, aimed at solidifying my understanding of core principles while exploring cutting-edge developments in technology.

These notes also reflect my ongoing journey to understand how computer science intersects with the rapidly evolving world of AI, as well as the broader implications these technologies have on society. Whether you're looking to dive deep into technical theory or seeking practical insights on AI applications, this compilation offers a rich resource for both learning and exploration.
